MAC FILE CONFIG
---------------

Configuration of the macConfigFile: it's a regular UNIX text file, with one line for every MAC. 
All data are separated with a space

format for every line:
MACADDRESS HOSTNAME IPADDRESS [NETMASK GATEWAY DNS1 DNS2 DOMAINNAME]

MACADDRESS, HOSTNAME and IPADDRESS are mandatory
if IPADDRESS is "dhcp" so NETMASK GATEWAY DNS1 DNS2 are optionnal, if IPADDRESS is a real IP address, they are mandatory 

example:
00053509717C host1 192.168.15.10 255.255.255.0 192.168.15.151 4.2.2.2 8.8.8.8 chippc.com
00053509718C host2 dhcp
00053509712C host3 dhcp


SYNC FOLDER
-----------
When using the Sync Folder feature, you can deploy any file in any area of the device, but no binary/executable.
There is 2 way to deploy files:
- all content of /sync/2xxx (or /sync/8xxx, depending of the deployed device) will be COPIED recursively at 
  the root / of the device (so, to deploy a file /etc/xxxx.ini on the device, you will need to put it in
  /sync/8xxx/etc/xxxx.ini for a 8xxx device, and /sync/2xxx/etc/xxxx.ini for a 2xxx device
- prepare a file named 2xxx.tar.gz or 8xxx.tar.gz with all the structure you want to deploy 
  on the device, and it will be automatically decompressed at the root / of the device
You can use both mecanism at the same time, if you do so, tar.gz will be applied first and 
then the simple copy will apply. So in case of conflict on the same file, the simple copy 
will have highest priority.

KNOWN ISSUES
------------
- When a language has been already applied, a new language change require a Reset Factory 
  of the device to apply (not critical)

REQUESTS FOR NEXT RELEASE
-------------------------

- Add VMWare Ignore SSL cert: we could modify the view-preferences files in the /root/.vmware folder. If you add “view.sllverificationmode = “3” here, the initial request about “connect insecure” will “suppressed”
- Add search domain in DHCP config - http://superuser.com/questions/110808/how-can-i-add-additional-search-domains-to-the-resolv-conf-created-by-dhclient-i
- Automated device Shutdown after last connection is ended
- PN Agent on start menu / Sub folder in menu and desktop
- Set a screen resolution, but leave user able to change it if he wants

- Screen rotation (1-2 screen, with L-Shape)

- DisplayLink driver (open kernel)
- Shutdown after idle time (via screensaver)
